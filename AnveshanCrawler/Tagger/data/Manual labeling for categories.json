{"content": "Thanks Vervain. I promise to do my damndest on this and not make it cheesy and unrealistic. You might...might...be surprised when it's done. I'll PM you with the Kindle link if that's ok (as far as forum rules go). I'm looking at this as kind of like an actor who's not a drug user but whose got to play one and make it convincing and moving and realistic for the audience...only the 'acting' is done on the page. Should he or she not do that role since they're not personally addicted? Mehhh. I don't think so. But, there again, it will all come down to talent and thorough research of the life experiences of the character. And plus, the story's not being told from the addicted character's POV. It's being told from her non-addicted daughter's POV, long after the fact, so the narrative approach is a bit different. It'll give me some wiggle room, as they say.","annotation":{"labels":["ALcohol & Drugs"],"note":""},"extras":null,"metadata":{"first_done_at":1532618534000,"last_updated_at":1532618534000,"sec_taken":17,"last_updated_by":"yevFOBbsaFOP9hXvWRPJle2Kmlg2","status":"done","evaluation":"NONE"}}
